## History

- __2016 (begining of)__. I met with a private company that needed a robot to handle the goods from their food stores. My solution was to use [Jenny 5 robot](https://jenny5.org) for this purpose. Even if *Jenny 5 robot* has three Logitech C910 cameras, we had no serious algorithm capable of recognizing foods. So, the first step was to build a dataset with many images of foods that could be fed into a neural network as training data ...

- __2016 (at the end)__. I started collecting fruits (either from my own garden or purchased from local stores). I stuck them into a low-rpm motor and filmed them. Initially, the films were made inside my room, which has blue-painted walls, whose reflection is visible in many images from that time.

- __2017 (begining of)__. A student of mine wrote an example of using TensorFlow for the Fruits-360 dataset.

- __2017 (summer of)__. The student presented his work at a local symposium for students.

- __2017 (end of)__. A more complete paper with the dataset and numerical experiments has been accepted and publised by *Acta Univ. Sapientiae*. The paper has been updated several times after publication to include results for newer dataset versions.

- __2017 (end of)__. The dataset has been uploaded to Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moltean/fruits).

- __2021 (begining of)__. Original (captured) size images will be published from now on.

- __2021 (begining of)__. The metadata (properties) of fruits will be included in the dataset.

- __2024.02.17__. The dataset has been moved to a new location on GitHub: [https://gihub.com/fruits-360](https://gihub.com/fruits-360). The organization contains multiple repositories.

## Provenance

All fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds etc, are from:

- my own garden (located in Cugir, Romania) or
- purchased, by me, from local stores.

I have recorded all the movies containing the fruits, vegetables, etc in the Fruits-360 dataset.

I have extracted (from movies) all pictures in the Fruits-360 dataset.

I have NOT taken pictures from other sources.

I have NOT generated artificial pictures of fruits, vegetables etc.
